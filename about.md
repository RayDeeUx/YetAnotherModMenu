## <c-FF0000>A Friendly Reminder</c>

<c-FF0000>Bug reports ***__must__*** go through Discord, unless if you're willing to wait anywhere from 6 days to 19 years for a response back.</c>

## <cy>Disclaimer</c>

When Geode v5 releases (so a *very* distant time from now), many of this mod's features ***_<c-FF0000>may</c>_*** be removed from this mod and merged into [Eclipse Menu](mod:eclipse.eclipse-menu). When this process is complete, this mod will exclusively become a <c-FFD700>coinfinder mod</c> and a <co>"pulse node to the main menu music" mod</c>.
